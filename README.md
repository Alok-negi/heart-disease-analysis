# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction

This project analyzes a heart disease dataset and applies Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.  

The program does the following:  
- Loads and processes the dataset  
- Performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizes patterns and correlations in the data  
- Trains multiple ML models, including:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Naive Bayes  
- Compares the performance of these models using accuracy and evaluation metrics  
- Highlights which model performs the best on the dataset  

The dataset used in this project is included in the repository (`data/heart-disease.csv`).

## üôå About This Project
This project is part of my Machine Learning practice.  
It demonstrates how different algorithms perform on the same dataset and helps in understanding which methods work better for medical prediction problems like heart disease diagnosis.
